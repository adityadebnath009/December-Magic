# December-Magic
Its a website based on the last month of the year.

I created "December Magic", a responsive and visually captivating landing page celebrating the wonders of December. My goal was to combine the warmth of the season with an interactive user experience. The landing page features:

A sticky navigation bar for easy access to different sections.
A countdown timer to New Year 2025, adding a sense of anticipation.
Sections highlighting winter phenomena, holiday celebrations, and cultural traditions.
A beautiful background with a "snow overlay" effect to immerse users in the winter theme.
Through this project, I aimed to enhance my frontend development skills while embracing the festive spirit.
